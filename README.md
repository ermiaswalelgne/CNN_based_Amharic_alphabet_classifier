# CNN based Amharic Alphabet Classifier
- [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic) Amharic is one of an ancient language that under sematic family, which has its alphabet and writing systems.
 It is widely used in Ethiopia and currently serves as a working language in Ethiopia.
 - This is a sample use case that demonstrates how the Convolutional Neural Network [(CNN)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) can be trained and modeled to classify the Amharic alphabets.
 The sample letters given for this demo case are `ha`, `le`, and `me.` I am collecting more alphabets, and the model will be improved further to identify all families of the Amharic alphabet.

 - The code can be easily reproduced and extended to include more alphabets. Make sure that all the necessary python packages listed in the import' section are installed on your device. Also, note how the folder hierarchy of the dataset is structured.  The code is tested on Pyhon3.6. 

 - I will expand the description and include more detail steps further in the future.
